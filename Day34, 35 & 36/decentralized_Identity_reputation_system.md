# Decentralized Identity and Universal Reputation System

```$
Group 4 : Open App Use Case
```
Building decentralized reputation as a smart contract offers a standardized
way of accessing reputation data that has been accumulated, where more
verifications across platforms can reinforce the reliability of any one reputation score.

The purpose and advantages of a ‘universal reputation system’ seem obvious: 
if a single reputation score could be used on most online marketplaces, 
not only might the barriers of entry to new platforms be reduced, 
it could unite isolated seller communities and potentially increase online market growth.


With Decentralized Identity in picture it'll be more trust worthy as you can verify 
identity of brand or user, also it'll help users over a platform to have complete 
and total control over there data.
