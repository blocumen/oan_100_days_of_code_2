# User Notification 

An open app which allows services to send notification to account holders of platforms

### Problem With current notification systems
Most push notifications are centralised and require association of device ids to usernames (for example: Facebook knows you have signed in because they have a server monitoring that). 

The open app will allow users to be in direct control of what services they get notification from, it imposes rules on the services including spam protection for users, limiting their ability to add accounts as subscribers, etc.
