Idea: BC P2P Lender - Barrower


P2P platforms offer unsecured loans, and interest rates are higher for borrowers compared to those offered by banks and NBFCs. Faircent, Lendenclub, i2ifunding, Cashkumar, RupeeCircle and Lendbox are some prominent P2P platforms.

Typically, people who borrow on P2P platforms are those who don’t get loans from banks because of a weak credit profile or very low income.


*** There are some P2P platforms not registered with the RBI and claim guaranteed returns on lending, through advertisements or via their websites.

1. A person with an ‘F’ grade (known to be of the weakest credit profile) gets to borrow at a rate of around 25 per cent.
2. Around 20-30 per cent borrowers enrolling on P2P platforms have no credit history. Generally, they don’t get loans from banks or non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).


Problem statement: The lending amount Rs 1 lakh was divided among 20 borrowers. “In the initial two months lender received the monthly instalments on a specific date assigned by the platform. However, afterwards, some of the borrowers started postponing instalments and others defaulted for a couple of months,” says Surendra. Within a span of one year, he could recover a meagre Rs 20,000. This amount included principal and interest. He couldn’t recover remaining amount.
