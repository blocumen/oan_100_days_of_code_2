## Blockchain in digital advertising industry

### Use case 
- Using blockchain technology in digital advertising industry will give more 
clear insights to the brands on where their advertisements are being published,
decreasing the ability of ad firms to publish the ads on the fraudulent sites
where bots are used to increase the clicks of the ads in turn generating more
revenues from the brand. 

- The record of transaction can be maintained in the blocks to track the
transaction between brands, ad buyers and the sites where the ads are being 
advertised. Also, the implementation of smart contract can enable a performance
based system where the payment between brand to an ad firm and an ad firm to 
the website hosting the ads will be fair enough based on the number of audience
the ad is reaching. Further, the ad firm acting as a middleware can be completely
removed if the decentralised ad network is hosted reducing the cost required to advertised. 

### Why blockchain Is necessary -
- To remove the monopoly of large players in the market who are manipulating the data and information to make a huge profit margin.
- To let the brands know that they are receiving a fair share of profit.
- To reduce the advertisement cost.

### Type of blockchain needed - 
Public blockchain
