## UOP (Unified OTT Platform)

#### What is OTT Service?

The standard Wikipedia definition goes like this:

> An **over-the-top** ('*OTT'* **media service**) is a [streaming media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media) service offered directly to viewers via the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). OTT bypasses [cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television), [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_television), and [satellite television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television) platforms, the companies that traditionally act as a controller or distributor of such content.



This is often called as VoD(Video-on-Demand) or SVoD(Subscription based VoD). that offers access to film and television content including existing web series from other produces as well as the content produced by own production houses.

There are plenty of OTT or SVoD platform out there like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ HotStar, Sony Liv, Zee5 Premium, etc.



#### How it works?

Let's say an user is a very big fan of **Game of Thrones(GoT)** and wants to re watch the entire season. Before he starts steaming the content there are certain checklist items from the OTT platform itself to allow the subscriber to stream the content. Following are the questions which are supposed to be answered/satisfied by the user before streaming the content.

* Is the user eligible to view the content? Ex: age restrictions.
* Did the user subscribe to any of the plans which the platform is providing?
* Is the subscribed plan expire?
* Is the content which the user is requesting to stream is part of the plan which he subscribed?

The following picture roughly depicts the workflow of the application.

* At first, the user logins to the app where the content is streamed.
* Once he logs in, he will look for the content, here GoT
* Once he finds the content he will start watching it.
* But here is a catch, the app is smart enough to check if the user has bought the subscription before streaming the content.
* If he has already bought the content, then he will be able to watch the content without any problems.
* Or else, he will be prompted with the available subscription plans and the user choses accordingly and makes the payment.
* Voila!! he is now eligible to stream the content.

So, this is quite an explanation about the platform. But the user suddenly changed his mind while watching GoT season3  because a new season **Scam 1992** has been released on **Sony Liv** platform. Which takes us to the next topic.



#### Drawbacks

The user now wants to watch **Scam 1992** season and no more wants to **GoT** season. What would he do now?

Well, before he can take any decision, he will have these questions in his mind...

* Do I have **Sony Liv** subscription?
* I have already bought the Disney+ HotStar subscription, what would I do with that?
* I don't want to pay more money just to watch that one particular season.
* Do I have an option to pay through Disney+ HotStar subscription?

What would you do in such scenario? 

The only option right now we could think of is, buying a new subscription for **Sony Liv**.



#### Our Solution

Here, we are addressing the problem with multiple OTT platforms who streaming amazing content on different OTT platforms.

What if I say, you can view all of the content using only one account?

Yes, you are right. You can hold one account and then can stream all the content on all the platforms at a time.

Here is the very high level overview of the idea.
