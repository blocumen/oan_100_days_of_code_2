 ## BetterRide
 
 ### Problem Statement
 - There are a lot of vehicle rental platforms/apps which provide customers with 
 daily, weekly, and even monthly rentals.
 
 - Few examples are - ZoomCar, Revv, Bounce, Vogo
 
 - Though they provide a convenience of renting vehicles instead of buying new ones,
 lot of customers complain about the experience they had while renting them.

 - Because of repeated usage, the vehicles need frequent maintenance. And this requirement,
 for some reason, does not often get fulfilled.
 
 - There are often bad reviews by customers, where they express about the vehicle's
 dirtiness, engine failures and other mechanical problems.
 
 - Though the platform assures that the problems would be resolved. Their actions do not
 meet the expectations.
 
 ### Solution
 - A blockchain-based extension, which tracks all about the vehicles, including:
 1. customers who rented it last
 2. service details
 3. issues faced previously
 
 - So before customers rent a vehicle, they will be able to see its information, and
 later decide whether to take it or not. This information will also be really helpful, when the
 company decides to sell any used vehicle to the public.
 
 - This will also push the rental company to focus towards better maintenance and services.
 Because if they don't, then the vehicle would sit as it is and would not generate any
 revenue for them.
 
 - Also, there has to be a reward-penalty mechanism, which ensures that the information
 entered is valid.
 
 - The extension can also have IOT support, to ensure minimum human intervention
