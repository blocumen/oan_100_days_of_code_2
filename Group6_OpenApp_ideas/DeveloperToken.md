# Knowledge Token/Tips

### Problem Statement
 - There are a lot of platforms which provide developers with materials for reference,
 be it for code, technical details, knowledge about a topic, etc.

 - Few examples are - StackOverflow, Medium, GitHub
 
 - They do provide a means of appreciation for the authors - like starring a repository on GitHub,
 clapping in medium, upvote in StackOverflow, so on and so forth.
 
 - Although these provide some kind of a reputation for the authors, there is no other benefit for them.
 
 - In addition to that, there is no penalty mechanism in certain cases.

### Solution
 - An extension, which when enabled, allows users to tip the authors, or even earn with the help of the
 already existing methods.
 
 - Examples can be - earning some tokens when someone stars your repository on GitHub, 
 or if your response gets upvoted on StackOverflow.
 
 - Accounts in any such platforms can be linked to the smartcontract using an emailID.
 
 - Obviously, when you are getting rewards, there should also be penalty for invalid things.
 This would enable people to contribute better articles/code/solutions.
