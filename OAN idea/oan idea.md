## IDEA  :A bridge between retailers on e-commerce platforms and the customers.

### Problems: It is hard for new retailers/sellers to get into online e-commerce platforms. Some of the  problems they face are:
1. Customers don’t submit reviews unless they are unhappy with the product .And  customers buy from those retailers who have positive reviews and many credible reviews , this makes it hard for new retailers to establish themselves.
2. Amazon doesn’t verify if the product is authentic or not , unless the retailer buys a product in large quantities then order gets verified , for some retailers who buy at small quantities their products are not verified.
Ex : when I bought puma shoes from flipkart , it turned out to be fake , there was no way for me to verify if the product is authentic  or not before placing the order .
3. Difficult to maintain loyal customer base , unable to create customer specific offers .
4. Excessive competition for exposure in the search results.


To get around this many retailers  are creating  their own website , but this creates a new set of  problems like 
1. Website creation and maintenance cost
2. Arranging their own delivery system
3. Cybersecurity 
4. Visibility :people are not able to find the site easily.
5. Reaching wider audience/ Scalability

### Solution :
1. We can create a contract where if user submits a  review , some token is awarded to the customer.
2. Retailers can put their product / inventory bills on blockchain so that customers can verify it.
3. Retailer can maintain database of customers with customer’s consent, and retailers can create customer specific deals like birthday special offer etc.
    Retailers create their own crypto tokens  and then award those for buying something, so that customers can visit again to buy different objects using earlier tokens.
4. Customers add their trusted retailers into their extension , so the products from these retailers  would be visible first in the search result.
 
I think in the future retailers who have stores will move to online e-commerce platforms due to high store rent or decrease in customer visits etc  , and they would like to move their own customers to e-commerce platforms . For example due to pandemic many store owners set up their own website or moved to e-commerce platforms due to less customer visits .
 
I think the retailer(middlemen) can serve in many interesting ways in future . Like the retailers can collect money before delivering the product (crowdfunding) , then retailers can negotiate with the producer to deliver at lower price , retailers might have access to the markets and producers that the average customer cannot have and negotiate in bulk or large order can reduce individual price , this can help customers to get the product at lower cost . i.e => customers can send money and can receive tokens then when the product comes to life they can use those tokens to buy the product or trade .
 
 
### Remarks:
Sanjay = Makes sense, I think this seems relevant and should be followed with the next step where you see if there is a possibility to start without a partnership with the platform team at first?

At present i am thinking the customers would have to  generate a private and public key in Aion blockchain and then enter the “Aion address “ into the delivery address section and API at retailer end would decode it , provide appropriate award or take appropriate action against that “aion address “  , by this way i wouldn’t need to partner up with the platforms directly . 

The retailers will deploy contracts into aion blockchain and store appropriate details , for example retailer stores bill in blockchain , the extension will provide the link for product  against the product in e-commerce site.
